# Working of the bot
A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation.As soon as the program starts bot function is automatically called.Then this bot starts the chat by greeting the user after taking his name as input.Then the bot introduces itslef.Then the bot calls the menu function.It displays the list of items it can perform and asks the user to enter his/her choice.If user enters 0 then currency converter function is called.It converts values from one currency to another currency.If user enters 1 then the current time is displayed.If user enters 2 then calculator function is called.It asks an expression as input and returns it answer as output.If the user enters 3 then the facts function is called ,it returns an interesting fact.This menu function executes continuosly until the user enters 4 which terminates the loop.At last the bot concludes this conversation by printing thanks note..

## Conclusion
With the experience that I've gained by doing this project I would like to make a chatbot which helps a student for his academic development with the help of my team mates. The functionalities of chatbot that we've planned so far are:
1. It should suggest best textbooks for students.
2. It should suggest best courses on different platforms like udemy,coursera,edx etc.,
3. It should conduct quizzes to the student.
#### Thank You
